			<p>Floats are taken out of the normal flow during layout, and hence they do not affect the vertical positioning of block-level elements.
			Floats are aligned to either the left or right outer edge of their container.
			Floats are stacked starting from either the left or right edge, and are stacked in the order they appear in markup. In other words, for right-floated boxes, the first right-floated box is positioned on the right edge of the box that contains it and the second right-floated box is positioned immediately left of the first box. source
			Floats can, however, affect the current and subsequent elements' inline-level content's line boxes. Specifically, any current and subsequent line boxes are shortened to make space for the float.
			Because floats are not in the normal flow, hey do not normally affect parent height. This is one reason why the "clearfix" technique was developed.
